How the app works: 
The user opens the app and presses the search button in the page or in the navbar.
The user enters a list of ingredients available in his kitchen and can also sort from a category dropdown,
presses search and chooses from the carefully selected recipes that are relevant for him. 
He can click on recipes to get more information about them.
He can return to the homepage anytime using the navbar button and make a new search.
The search can be made using only the searchbar for the ingredients, only the category selector, both or none.

App uses ruby 3.2 and rails 7.
